Joltbitz is all about making shockingly cool software just because we can ;)

@joltbitz we create software we want to use, hopefully you'll like to use it too. We focus on the 10% of cool functionality that you want to use often, and leave the 90% of bloat software by the wayside.

Let's start with ShakeOnFlashLight app for Android: 

Why ShakeOnFlashLight? Because when you need a flashlight is not the time to mess around with menus on your phone. Just shake and voila, your flashlights are on or off.
